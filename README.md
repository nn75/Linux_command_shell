## Linux_command_shell
• Built a simplified multi-process bash shell on Linux in C++. 

• Fully parsed input line and implemented running built-in Linux commands set/cd/export without full path by searching PATH environment.

• Improved shell by implementing redirections with taking input from files and exporting output to files. Also added pipelines to allow processes to communicate with others. 

• Fully tested and debugged the shell with deliberate test planning.
